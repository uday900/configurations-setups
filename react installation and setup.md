Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to installing React with Vite for creating a new project:

### 1. **Install Node.js**
   - Ensure you have **Node.js** installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).  
   - Check if Node.js is installed by running the following commands in your terminal:

     node -v
     npm -v
     ```

### 2. **Create a New React Project using Vite**
   - Open your terminal and navigate to the folder where you want to create your project.
   - Run the following command to create a new project using Vite:
     ```bash
     npm create vite@latest
     ```
   - You will be prompted to name your project. Enter the name and press `Enter`.
   - Then select **React** as your framework and **JavaScript** or **TypeScript** as the variant (based on your preference).

### 3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   After the project is created, go to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-project-name
   ```

### 4. **Install Dependencies**
   - Install all the required project dependencies by running:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

### 5. **Start the Development Server**
   - To start the development server, run:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - The development server will start, and you will get a local development URL like `http://localhost:5173`.

### 6. **Access Your React App**
   - Open your browser and go to the URL provided by the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).
   - You should see your basic React app created with Vite.
