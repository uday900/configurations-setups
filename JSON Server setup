Installation of JSON Server
JSON Server is offered as a NPM package. You can install the same by executing the following on the command prompt:

-> npm install -g json-server

JSON File
Create a JSON file with name employees.json. This file consists of the data, that must be exposed by the REST API. CRUD endpoints are automatically created for objects in the JSON structure.       

The JSON has of one ‘employees’ array which has two objects. Each employee object consists of properties: id, name and designation.

Running the Server
Start the JSON server by executing the following command:

-> npx json-server --watch employees.json --port 4000


As a parameter we need to pass the json file (employees.json).
The — watch parameter starts the server in watch mode. This means that it watches for any changes in the file and updates the exposed API accordingly.
The --port specifies the port to run the json-server. The default port number is 3000
The following HTTP endpoints are automatically created by JSON server:

GET    /employees
GET    /employees/{id}
POST   /employees

PUT    /employees/{id}

PATCH  /employees/{id}

DELETE /employees/{id}
